## **HW1**:

* ### ***Heart_Disease_Prediction***
    In this assignment, I worked on [*Heart_Disease*](https://www.kaggle.com/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset) dataset.
    Topics I used:
    > * EDA
    > * Perceptron
    > * Naive Bayes
    
    Also these basic topics used:
    > * Confusion Matrix
    > * F1-score
    > * Recall_score
    > * Precision_score

* ### ***MLE_MAP***
    This exercise will help you gain a deeper understanding of, and insights into, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (*MLE*) and Maximum A Posteriori (*MAP*) estimation.
